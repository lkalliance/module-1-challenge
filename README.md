# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

I edited this page's HTML and CSS to improve its semantics and to make its CSS more efficient. In coding these edits, I had to change HTML tags, condense some HTML elements, and reorganize and condense CSS rules.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

There is no change necessary to the user's interaction with this page. It remains a static web page, and it presents its information to the user in the same way. It will present its information to screen readers in a more semantic way.

## Credits

Original visual and structural designer of the page unknown.
